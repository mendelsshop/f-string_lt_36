# f-string_lt_37 Regex Edition
## About: 
Python f-strings for before Python 3.7. using Regex
<br>
This package should try to emulate all f-string features <br>by using a class that inherits from str.
<br>
This package requires the re (regular expressions, regex) module.
<br>
To my knowledge most versions of Python have re, if not you can use the non regex version
<br>
So it should be able to install on any Python version.
<br>
Although it's not been tested if thats true because it's not working yet.
<br>
## Features currently working:
